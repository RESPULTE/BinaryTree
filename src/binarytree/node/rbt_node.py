class RBT_Node(BBST_Node):
    '''
    node for the RBT class (Red-Black Tree)
    - each node is categorized by its color, whether it's black or red

    ALL INVARIANTS:

        i. a red parent cannot have any red child
        ii. the root must be black
        iii. every path to every node must contain the same number of black node


    - by far the most troublesome one that I've implemented

    - I don't know how the heck anything works in this tree,
      all the steps to balance it sounds like magical mumbo-jumbo

    - I don't even know if it works properly or not, 
      it looks like it does, so... that's promising i guess?
